                <p>
                  Nemesis Imports was founded in 2025 by Cason Pewitt, a United States 
                  Marine Corps veteran with a deep passion for motorsports and Japanese 
                  automotive culture. After serving overseas in Japan, stationed in the 
                  smaller city of Iwakuni in Yamaguchi prefecture, Cason discovered the 
                  incredible world of JDM performance and community.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During his time in Japan, Cason developed meaningful relationships with 
                  local car enthusiasts, people deeply connected to FDJ (Formula Drift Japan), 
                  and performance shops that were bringing the absolute best out of these 
                  iconic vehicles. This immersion into authentic Japanese car culture opened 
                  his eyes to the engineering prestige and racing heritage that defines JDM.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Based in Franklin, Tennessee, Nemesis Imports was created to bring the 
                  growing Middle Tennessee and surrounding areas a trustworthy source for 
                  all things JDM. Our mission is to stand above other import companies by 
                  making these newly US-legal cars easily accessible to anyone drawn to 
                  these iconic vehicles and the community that surrounds them.
